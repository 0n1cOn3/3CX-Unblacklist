###### Tested with 3CX V18
After all the back and forth with 3CX, I have not been able to find anything else as an alternative that meets my needs. Therefore I take over the maintenance of this script. 
I have rewritten the whole thing from scratch and simplified and adapted some things.

### 2023.03.01 - No more maintenance by fgadot

Due to the disaster the latest 3CX V18U6 has been, we decided to move our customers away from 3CX to FreePBX
Therefore, this shell script won't be maintained anymore. Feel free to fork!

### 2019.03.05 - V0.1b - First release
###### Tested with 3CX V15, up to 3CX V16
First release is made in bash shell. Very simple, but I needed something quick. 
Down the road, we might switch to Python or Perl..
